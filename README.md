# Driving-Behavior-Cloning
Neural Network that mimics the driving behavior

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the driving simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around multiple track without leaving the road

My project includes the following files:
* behavior_cloning.py containing the script to train the model and use model for inference (if required)
* utils.py containing supplmentary python functions
* download_resources.sh shell file to download driving-simulator and default-training-dataset
* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode
* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network
